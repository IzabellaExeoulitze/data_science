@gzornick Why are people defending her. You can vote for Biden and not defend every single rightwing figure who dislikes Trump. Most of these never Trumpers have smeared Obama horribly in the past when it suited them. They just don't like Trump. That is all. They are still horrible people.,biden,2020-03-05 14:48:26,Maria_8419,Twitter Web App,1235577920678051841,https://twitter.com/statuses/1235577920678051841

"@LADYBUNNY77 No prob. tbh I can't hate Biden as a person, even if I do not want him as president. He and his son were supportive of transgender people and when his son died, our Danica Roem went to his funeral. I think he's a good person, just not who I want to win.
